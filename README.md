# Research on the application of blockchain in logistics
## Overview
### 1. Problem in logistics
The supply chain involves many different parties. There exist a lot of interaction and collaboration between different parties, and all kinds of information generated during the entire supply chain operation are seperatedly stored in their own systems. The information flow also lacks transparency.
* Low efficiency
  Because the information is seperated, it is difficult for the participating entities on the supply chain to accurately understand the status and existing problems of the related items. That reduces the efficiency of the system.
* High trust cost
  The opaque information flow leads to time-consuming of acountability and burdensome proof when there is a dispute between the various different parties in the supply chain.
### 2. What can Blockchain change?
Blockchain technology as a large-scale collaboration tool is naturally suitable for supply chain management.
* Improve efficiency

Blockchain technology enables data to be made public between parties. That forms a complete and smooth flow of information throughout the supply chain, which ensures that all parties involved find problems and find solutions to problems in real time.
* Better acountability and dispute resolution

Blockchain has the characteristics of data immutability and proof of the existence of timestamps.
