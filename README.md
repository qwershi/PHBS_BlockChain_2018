# Research on the application of blockchain in logistics
## Overview
### 1. Problem in logistics
The supply chain involves many different parties. There exist a lot of interaction and collaboration between different parties, and all kinds of information generated during the entire supply chain operation are seperatedly stored in their own systems. The information flow also lacks transparency.
#### 1.1 Low efficiency
Because the information is seperated, it is difficult for the participating entities on the supply chain to accurately understand the status and existing problems of the related items. That reduces the efficiency of the system.
#### 1.2 High trust cost
The opaque information flow leads to time-consuming of acountability and burdensome proof when there is a dispute between the various different parties in the supply chain.
### 2. What can Blockchain change?
Blockchain technology as a large-scale collaboration tool is naturally suitable for supply chain management.
#### 2.1 Improve efficiency
Blockchain technology enables data to be made public between parties. That forms a complete and smooth flow of information throughout the supply chain, which ensures that all parties involved find problems and find solutions to problems in real time.
#### 2.2 Better acountability and dispute resolution
Blockchain has the characteristics of data immutability and proof of the existence of timestamps.
## Examples
### 1. [TradeLens](https://www.tradelens.com/) - Internatinal shipping
As the world's largest container shipping company, `Maersk` has been focusing on how to use innovative technology to transform, optimize the processes in its shipping lines to further enhance the company's own competitiveness and reduce costs and improve efficiency, thus providing customers with a better logistics experience. The cooperation between `IBM` and `Maersk` has been around for a long time, and both parties are committed to achieving this goal. However, the complexity of global trade and shipping logistics is too high. Many airline buyers, sellers, third-party logistics, port supervision, financial institutions and other network participants are faced by each route, and they want to solve shipping through a centralized platform. The problems faced by logistics are very difficult. The `TradeLens` platform has been implemented by `IBM` and `Maersk` for several years and is built on a blockchain platform. It has been commercially available in the end of 2018.

The scale of global trade has grown at an alarming rate, but it has also encountered difficult inefficiencies and complexity. Faced with data from isolated islands, disparate trading views, and inefficient paper processes, the industry and supply chain partners supporting the industry are in desperate need of disruptive change. The `TradeLens` network is at the heart of this transformation.

`TradeLens` is the product of a partnership agreement between `Maersk` and `IBM` to lay the foundation for building a digital supply chain that supports multiple trading partners to collaborate, such as publishing and subscribing to event data, without prejudice to details, privacy or other confidentiality rights. Create a unified shared trading view. `TradeLens` supports digital collaboration among multiple stakeholders involved in international trade. Shippers, ocean carriers, freight forwarders, port and terminal operators, inland transporters, customs authorities and other stakeholders have real-time access to transport data and transport documents (including IoT and sensor data), thereby Efficient interaction and cooperation.

`TradeLens` is building an industry advisory board of ecosystem actors to help manage the evolving network, shape the platform and promote open standards. The network is working closely with organizations such as the` UN Trade Facilitation` and `E-Commerce Center` (UN/CEFACT) and industry organizations such as `OpenShipping.org` to help ensure interoperability. In the future, third parties can build applications and deploy them to the `TradeLens` market, bringing new value to network members.

#### 1.1 Pain point of international shipping
The development of global maritime logistics is getting faster and faster, and the scale of formation is also growing. According to statistics: Up to now, more than 16 trillion US dollars of goods are transported through the international border each year; 80% of the goods used by consumers every day are carried out by sea. If we can reduce barriers within the international supply chain, global trade can grow by nearly 15%, thereby promoting economic growth and creating jobs.

However, global trade is currently extremely inefficient and is being dragged down by paper-based business processes. Since the data of the participants is isolated in the business process running in a silo organization, this leads to a lack of uniform standards between the data, which is very difficult to share. Since each participant uses a different standard system, it is processing In the process and data state, the content presented by each system is inconsistent. Due to the large number of upstream and downstream participants, some of the participants still have no business system or business system inefficiency. Due to the existence of non-standard data and possible data fraud in the entire long chain, errors or even false ones may be cited in the final customs clearance process, so the entire customs clearance process is vulnerable to fraud.

Take `Maersk`’s avocado transport from Mombasa to Rotterdam as an example. According to effective statistics, there are 30 roles, more than 100 executives and nearly 200 exchanges of information, which brings many problems:

* Inconsistent information across organizational boundaries and blind spots throughout the supply chain hinder the effective flow of goods;
* Complex, cumbersome, and expensive peer-to-peer messaging;
* Manual, time-consuming, paper-based processes;
* Risk assessment often lacks sufficient information and customs clearance procedures are vulnerable to fraud.

#### 1.2 Advantages of TradeLens
The `TradeLens` platform was designed from the ground up to build an energy efficient networked ecosystem that addresses global trade and shipping logistics. The core business network consists of members of the `TradeLens` network, such as operators, ports and customs, financial institutions, shippers, in-port logistics, third-party logistics, etc. They connect platforms to provide data to the platform. Through the synergy formed by members, a platform based on the commercial network is formed. The platform is designed to be accessible through open APIs and can integrate the entire ecosystem of the long chain of supply chains so that all parties in the industry can share information and Collaborate effectively. Blockchain and cloud technology provide effective support for the platform. On the business network and platform, `TradeLens` builds applications and services, an open application and services market that allows platform parties and third parties to publish their own business applications and services.

`TradeLens` has four major advantages:

* Connecting the ecosystem

`TradeLens` brings together all parties in the supply chain – including traders, freight forwarders, inland transport, ports and terminals, ocean carriers, customs and other government agencies, and others – in a blockchain-based chain. And on a platform with a security license and identity framework.
* True information sharing

`TradeLens` provides seamless, secure, real-time, actionable supply chain information to be shared among trading parties, including transportation milestones, cargo details, trade documents, structured data embedded in trade documents, customs filing, Sensor readings and more.

* Promote collaboration and trust

`TradeLens` makes the digitization and automation of cross-organizational business processes an integral part of global trade, including import and export customs clearance, and blockchains to ensure safe, auditable and non-repudiation transactions.

* Stimulating innovation

`TradeLens` builds the foundation for continuous improvement and innovation through open, non-proprietary APIs, usage standards and interoperability, and launching the application market, where parties can build and deploy tradelens for themselves, partners and customers. Based application.

### 2. Hazardous material transportaiton
Transportation of hazardous material should consider not only cost and efficiency, but also security. Secuirity is the most important.
* Blockchains can be used to monitor the flow and status of hazardous material in the whole logistics in real time, accurately and effectively, so that the regulatory authorities can conduct pre-regulation rather than accountability after the accident.
* All the information of agencies, suppliers, and transporters in the supply chain are written into the blockchain. The information will be permanently stored in the blockchain. Once accident happens, it is convenient to inqure.
### 3. [ShipChain](https://shipchain.io/) - Decentralized brokerage shipping
In the process of shipping, `brokers` coordinate `carriers` (provide transportation service) to organize orders and get payment from `shippers` (customers). Brokers charge a high middle-man markup, sometimes 30-50%. Traditionally, it is hard to get rid of `brokers` because establishing trust between `shippers` and `carriers` is difficult.
* By using the token as incentive, `carriers` can organize themselves to find shipments and intelligently route their team under the constrain of smart contract.
* The whole transportation process is clear. The status of the shipment can be obtained in real time by `shippers`.
* The link between online and offline is difficult to achieve. Stricter constrain in smart contract is needed.
### 4. Signing for express delivery
The final link of logistics natrually has a signing process. It is easy to come up an idea to use `private key` to make digital signature and use `public key` to verify identity when signing for express delivery.
* Secuirity. It is impossible for to received others' express delivery maliciously if everyone keep his `private key` a secret.
* Privacy. What exposed to the public is only the user's `public key`. No personal information can be read from Blockchain, even including phone numbers.
* Requirement is not enough. Blockchain increase the cost of the whole system if the accuracy and efficeny are high. Customers would not have such strong requirement to protect their privacy when the cost is too much. 
### 5. Charity in logistics
Some logistics companies claim that they will donate to charity every time they complete a single delivery. However, the customers do not know whether the company does it or not, and which donation is generated from their own delivery.
* In Blockchain, each donation has real delivery to support. It can make sure the whole donated amount is accurate.
* For each customer, he will exactly know how much donation is generated from his delivery, and where the moeny go to.
